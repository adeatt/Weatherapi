# Weatherapi
A small weather api programm which gives you data about the weather. Currently uses openweathermap but should work with others to.
Disclaimer: This Project is only made for training purposes. Its not that eficient.

Modules: requests, pyodbc, pandas

It starts by getting the data via the request link and the Api key which is only avaible on the site of the api provider. 
Connects to the database via pyodbc and inserts the data.
