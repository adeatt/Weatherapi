# Weatherapi
A small weather api programm which gives you data about the weather. Currently uses openweathermap but should work with others to.

Modules: requests

It starts by getting the data via the request link and the Api key which is only avaible on the site of the api provider.
Nothing to complicatet it just takes this info puts it into .json and prints it out.

Could be usefull for implemting it with a Access Database.

I did this for a project so yeah. Dont expect much.
